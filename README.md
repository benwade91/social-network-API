## Description:

The Social-Network API communicates with a NoSQL MongoDB database with the help of MongooseODM. It allows users to create, read, update and delete USERS, THOUGHTS and REACTIONS. When a user creates a new thought, their profile is updated with the corresponding thought. When the thought is deleted, the user profile is updated, removing the thought. When a user is deleted, all of their thoughts are deleted as well. When a user adds a friend, both profiles reflect the friendship. When a friendship is terminated, both profiles are updated.
